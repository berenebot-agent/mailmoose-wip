# Changelog

All notable changes to MailMoose are documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the
project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Self-hosted Direct MX outbound delivery with DNS MX resolution, opportunistic
  STARTTLS, public-destination enforcement, and single-recipient delivery.

- Agent discovery surface: `/.well-known/mailmoose`, `/agent`, `/docs`,
  `/openapi.json` (request, response and query schemas plus a machine-readable
  `x-required-role`), `/v1/limits`, `/v1/health`, `/changelog`, and served
  Bash, Python and curl example clients.
- `GET /v1/messages/wait` and `GET /v1/events/wait` long-polling with durable
  `evt_` cursors.
- External sending aliases with per-alias sending connectors and display names.
- One-shot draft writes with inline and multipart attachments, plus a
  human-in-the-loop send-approval workflow including email approvals.
- Direct SMTP (MX) ingress as an embedded edge or a separate container, with
  SPF, DKIM and DMARC verification.

### Changed

- Renamed Gatehouse Mail to MailMoose. This is breaking: the module path,
  binary and image names, and the discovery path
  (`/.well-known/gatehouse` → `/.well-known/mailmoose`) all changed.
- Send responses report `queued: false` once `?wait=true` has resolved.

### Fixed

- `/v1/messages/wait` no longer replays history: with no cursor it blocks for
  new mail, and a malformed cursor is rejected with `400`.
- Empty-subject sends are rejected with a descriptive `400` instead of failing
  later at the provider.
- `limit` values below 1 and non-integer `limit`/`timeout` query values are
  rejected with `400` instead of being silently defaulted.
- Reply threading matches the provider's wire Message-ID, so replies join the
  original conversation even when the provider rewrites `Message-ID`.
- Outbox delivery panics are contained instead of crashing the worker.
- Non-UTF-8 encoded message headers are decoded correctly.

### Security

- `FORCE_HTTPS` redirects plaintext requests to HTTPS and reports HTTPS in
  discovery documents; only trusted proxies may assert `X-Forwarded-Proto`.
- MX edge credentials are 256-bit.
