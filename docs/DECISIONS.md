# Gatehouse Email — V1 Decision Register

This file records architectural decisions the implementation should treat as settled unless a concrete requirement justifies revision.

## D001 — One codebase for hosted and self-hosted

**Decision:** Hosted and self-hosted deployments share the same core binary, API, mailbox model, and UI.

**Reason:** Dogfooding, simple maintenance, user trust, and easy portability.

## D002 — Go runtime

**Decision:** Implement V1 in Go.

**Reason:** Compact deployment, low idle resource use, strong networking/concurrency, and suitable standard-library primitives.

## D003 — Single-container runtime

**Decision:** Package V1 as one prebuilt Docker image containing one application process.

**Reason:** Simple self-hosting, backup, upgrade, and ARM64/amd64 deployment.

## D004 — SQLite + FTS5

**Decision:** Use SQLite in WAL mode for hosted and self-hosted V1.

**Reason:** Workload is initially modest, inbox records are lightweight, and SQLite keeps the operational footprint very small.

**Extension point:** Add a PostgreSQL store when measured hosted load makes it beneficial.

## D005 — Local filesystem MIME store

**Decision:** Store canonical raw MIME under `/data/messages`.

**Reason:** Simple persistence and backup, efficient streaming, and minimal runtime dependencies.

**Extension point:** Add object storage when hosted storage scale warrants it.

## D006 — Mailgun reference inbound transport

**Decision:** V1 inbound internet transport uses Mailgun HTTPS delivery.

**Reason:** It removes public SMTP/MX protocol operation from the application while keeping the provider adapter small.

**Boundary:** Mailgun-specific code remains isolated in `/internal/transport/mailgun`.

## D007 — BYO outbound

**Decision:** Users provide outbound credentials.

**V1 adapters:**
- Mailgun HTTP API
- generic SMTP
- Brevo HTTP API

Outbound adapters register through the provider registry, while each credential retains encrypted provider-specific configuration. The Admin UI renders provider-specific fields from a schema each adapter exposes, so users enter an API key and the relevant settings rather than raw JSON.

An account may hold multiple outbound credentials but selects exactly one **active** provider, stored as `accounts.active_outbound_credential_id`. All sending uses the active provider. Per-inbox credential assignment is deprecated and no longer consulted; it is retained only for backward compatibility.

**Reason:** Users retain provider choice, pricing, and sender reputation while hosted operation remains simple, and a single active provider keeps V1 sending predictable ahead of future failover.

## D008 — Replayable event history

**Decision:** SQLite events are the persistent realtime history.

**Interfaces:**
- incremental REST
- long-poll
- SSE

**Reason:** One recovery model supports both realtime and disconnected clients.

## D009 — Hermes Relay integration

**Decision:** Hermes Relay is the preferred realtime Hermes integration.

**Reason:** Hermes can maintain an outbound-only authenticated connection and receive new mail through native gateway messaging semantics.

**Boundary:** Relay remains an adapter over the mailbox/event core because its protocol is externally versioned.

## D010 — REST is canonical

**Decision:** REST/event APIs are the canonical generic agent interface.

**Reason:** Small token footprint, direct debugging, self-documentation, and client independence.

**Extension point:** MCP can be provided as an optional adapter.

## D011 — openagent.email compatibility

**Decision:** Preserve compatible endpoint names/fields where semantics align cleanly.

**Reason:** Familiar integration and easier migration.

**Boundary:** Native Gatehouse Email models remain authoritative for richer features.

## D012 — Lightweight web UI

**Decision:** Use embedded server-rendered or similarly compact web assets served by the Go binary.

**Reason:** Human administration requires forms, lists, search, and message inspection rather than a separate application runtime.

## D013 — Account storage as hosted capacity control

**Decision:** Hosted V1 uses account-level storage/fair-use controls while logical inbox identities remain cheap to create.

**Reason:** Storage reflects real infrastructure consumption more closely than inbox count.

## D014 — Mailbox roles plus account Admin

**Decision:** Permissions use three mailbox-level roles plus one account-level administrative role.

Mailbox roles are assigned independently per inbox:

```text
Read       → read messages/threads, search, attachments
Assistant  → Read + delete messages + create/edit drafts
Owner      → Assistant + send/reply + mailbox settings
```

A single key can have different roles on different inboxes.

Account administration is separate:

```text
Admin      → full account access
```

Admin can create/delete inboxes, manage domains, keys/users, outbound providers, Hermes connections, and account-wide settings.

**Reason:** This matches agent delegation: mailbox Owner grants full mailbox operation, while Admin grants account-wide administration.

## D015 — SQLite concurrency

**Decision:** Use one serialized SQLite writer connection plus a small bounded read pool, with WAL and a busy timeout.

**Reason:** Predictable concurrent behaviour with minimal runtime complexity.

## D016 — Mail integrity boundaries

**Decision:** Mailgun webhook tokens provide inbound delivery idempotency. Thread matching is scoped to the same account and inbox. Unknown recipients use a configured catch-all or receive a terminal transport rejection.

**Reason:** Stable retry behaviour and isolation between mailboxes/accounts.

## D017 — Root encryption key

**Decision:** `APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is the root secret for recoverable provider credentials and is backed up separately from `/data`.

**Reason:** Restoring encrypted credentials requires both application data and the root secret.

## D018 — Direct relay credential issuance

**Decision:** The admin UI and REST API issue Hermes relay credentials directly: generate the gateway id, secret, and delivery key, store the encrypted connection, and return a ready-to-paste `.env` block. The one-time enrollment-token flow (`POST /relay/enroll` plus `hermes gateway enroll`) remains for the CLI and hosted provisioning.

**Reason:** A self-hosted operator should be able to create a relay connection and paste the resulting environment variables without a separate token-exchange step or a hosted identity token.

## D019 — Dedicated inbound webhook listener

**Decision:** The application always runs a second HTTP listener on `:8082` that serves only the authenticated inbound webhook routes (`/internal/ingest/mailgun`, `/internal/ingest/{provider}`) and `/healthz`. The main listener continues to serve all routes.

**Reason:** This lets an operator expose only the inbound connector to the public internet while keeping the API, web UI, and Relay WebSocket on a private interface or firewall, reducing public attack surface. It remains one process, one container, and one store, so D003 is preserved. Ingest routes stay on the main listener for backward compatibility. The port is fixed rather than configurable so the split works with no extra configuration.

## Future extension register

Potential future additions include:

- additional inbound transport adapters
- custom-domain automation improvements
- optional managed outbound
- object storage
- PostgreSQL
- optional MCP bridge
- broader agent platform adapters
- richer team/organisation administration

Additions should preserve the canonical mailbox/event model.
